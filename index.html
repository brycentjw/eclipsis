    <p> If you're experienced, then you could read this for fun, new? Welcome to my "guide". <br>

        <h2>What is Eclipsis?</h2>
        <p> Eclipsis is a planet, and the name of the game in Roblox, the objective of the game is to clear map of other teams. <br>
            You can decide to play yourself, or form a team, only play solo if you're extremely experienced in the game itself. </p>
        <h2> Sections of the page: </h2>
        <ul>
            <li> Core game (You're here) </li>
        </ul>
        <h2> Core game </h2>
        <p> Here I will talk about the core of the game, you will typically see people talk about this. </p>
        <h3> Rating </h3>
        <p> Rating is a factor people will typically judge you by, you lose a match, you lose rating, you win a match, you win rating. <br>
            How much you lose or gain has several details, which I will explain here. <br>
            First of all, you will always start with 1200 rating. <br>
            Second of all, if you win a match your rating will increase depending on: </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Your rating compared to others (you gain more from others if they have more rating than you) </li>
            <li> Number of enemies in your match (you collectively gain rating from the above factor counting for each user) </li>
            <li> Number of people on your team (rating is evenly distributed among your team) </li>
        </ul>
        <p> The first point will be explained, if you have 1200 rating and you win against another player with 1200 rating, <br>
            you will get 3 ratings from that one player (if you're playing alone). <br>
            If you have 1200 rating and you beat somebody with less rating, <br>
            you will either gain 1 or 2 depending on how little they have. <br>
            If you have 1200 rating and you beat somebody with more rating, <br>
            you will gain 4, 5, or 6 rating depending on how much more they have than you. <br>
            If you have 3 enemies and you're playing yourself in a 1v3 situation and somehow win, <br>
            this system will apply to each enemy user individually, and will total up to the amount you will receive. <br>
            If you have teammates, however, the amount of rating will be divided among your teammates, <br>
            for example if your 3 man team receives 30 rating, each user (including you) will get 10 rating. <br>
            However, if your team gains 2 rating but you are a 5 man team, each user (including you) will get 1 rating. <br>
            If you lose a match, your rating will decrease depending on: </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Your rating compared to others (you lose more to others if they have less rating than you) </li>
        </ul>
        <p> Now it's just the opposite from winning a match, only this one factor will affect you. Nothing much to explain. </p>
