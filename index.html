    <p> If you're experienced, then you could read this for fun, new? Welcome to my "guide". <br>
        Contact me on Discord if you want to, Brycentjw#5295. <br>
        dont steal my content or i delete your roblox account <br>
        also let me finish up this css tutorial then i will actually fix this <br>
        I haven't finished this yet, quite a lot still left to finish up.</p>
        <h2>What is Eclipsis?</h2>
        <p> Eclipsis is a planet, and the name of the game in Roblox, the objective of the game is to clear map of other teams. <br>
            You can decide to play yourself, or form a team, only play solo if you're extremely experienced in the game itself. <br>
            The official lore made by Davidii the developer of the game can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQAy2_Ubo3e_6VlPERNYrDDPAt5qHiYYEdDAFgNel_9-yh3yN4Sk_ksVwRo6Dg5YP-YWsNwa4PluX2z/pub">
                here</a>. </p>
        <h2> Sections of the page(will become interactable soon): </h2>
        <ul>
            <li> Core game (You're here) </li>
            <li> Game wiki (WIP) </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="core game">
        <h2> Core game </h2>
        <p> Here I will talk about the core of the game, you will typically see people talk about this. </p>
            <div class="rating">
        <h3> Rating </h3>
        <p> Rating is a factor people will typically judge you by, you lose a match, you lose rating, you win a match, you win rating. <br>
            How much you lose or gain has several details, which I will explain here. <br>
            First of all, you will always start with 1200 rating. <br>
            Second of all, if you win a match your rating will increase depending on: </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Your rating compared to others (you gain more from others if they have more rating than you) </li>
            <li> Number of enemies in your match (you collectively gain rating from the above factor counting for each user) </li>
            <li> Number of people on your team (rating is evenly distributed among your team) </li>
        </ul>
        <p> The first point will be explained, if you have 1200 rating and you win against another player with 1200 rating, <br>
            you will get 3 ratings from that one player (if you're playing alone). <br>
            If you have 1200 rating and you beat somebody with less rating, <br>
            you will either gain 1 or 2 depending on how little they have. <br>
            If you have 1200 rating and you beat somebody with more rating, <br>
            you will gain 4, 5, or 6 rating depending on how much more they have than you. <br>
            If you have 3 enemies and you're playing yourself in a 1v3 situation and somehow win, <br>
            this system will apply to each enemy user individually, and will total up to the amount you will receive. <br>
            If you have teammates, however, the amount of rating will be divided among your teammates, <br>
            for example if your 3 man team receives 30 rating, each user (including you) will get 10 rating. <br>
            However, if your team gains 2 rating but you are a 5 man team, each user (including you) will get 1 rating. <br>
            If you lose a match, your rating will decrease depending on: </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Your rating compared to others (you lose more to others if they have less rating than you) </li>
        </ul>
        <p> Now it's just the opposite from winning a match, only this one factor will affect you. Nothing much to explain. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="howtoplay">
        <h3> How to play </h3>
        <p> <img src="https://images-ext-2.discordapp.net/external/o8D2fdaCS919hnnBtf3iui1hl2l03cZJ53tPN8H4b5c/https/pbs.twimg.com/media/D428BEyXkAYosl4.jpg%3Alarge" width="500" class="pic"> <br>
            Now you have figured out the 'points' system, time for you to start figuring out how to play. <br>
            As you spawn in, you will be on what is called a 'Starter Island', <br>
            this will have a single unclaimed well pipe and a fully filled up spawn point with 350 iridium in it. <br>
            Now as you may choose to stay here, it's a bad idea, <br>
            as there is only a single well pipe which can only be upgraded enough to do 12.5 ir/s. <br>
            Well pumps can be placed for 100 iridium, and then upgraded from there to make (in order): </p>
        <ol>
            <li> Fabricator </li>
            <li> Distributor </li>
            <li> Extra pumping power (boosts extractor power from 5 ir/s to 12.5 ir/s) </li>
        </ol>
        <p> Now that I have explained how a well pump works, <br>
            there are 2 choices which will do well easily for early game, <br>
            you can either make a sea base, or expand onto mainland. <br>
            I will talk about expanding onto mainland first, as it is much easier to master. </p>
            <h3> Mainland expansion </h3>
            <p> <img src="https://i.gyazo.com/8051c945d7179da991f7e6c9c5bf30d8.jpg" width="500" class="pic"> <br>
            Expanding onto the mainland, you can find clusters of well pipes of potentially 4 or 5, <br>
            with a potential of 50ir/s to 62.5 ir/s respectively. <br>
            To get there, you will need to build platform bridges, which are incredibly cheap, but easy to destroy. <br>
            Once you reach the cluster, building there will allow for you to setup an easy amount of production, <br>
            where it is still possible for you to find even more clusters of well pipes, to boost production. <br>
            Going any further will progress into mid game, where conflict will often initiate between teams. <br>
            I will now explain how you make sea bases, which is much harder to master than simply placing well pumps. </p>
        <h3> Sea basing </h3>
        <p> Making sea bases is exceptionally dangerous if you do not know how to build it. <br>
            You can either jump into the ocean and land on a pillar, or climb down using a ladder. <br>
            After reaching the ocean, remember to stay above the toxic fumes which will damage you, <br>
            depending on how near you are to the said ocean. <br>
            Place a wall sideways, with the side inside the ocean, while the top is still above the fumes which is somewhat visible. <br>
            Submersibles will produce iridium while inside the ocean, and the entire rod must be submerged for a potential of 12 ir/s, <br>
            which is extremely powerful, especially with the fact you can easily pull iridium from the ocean to fill in the need for 650 iridium. <br>
            Place Submersibles on the side of the wall, with the rod inside the iridium ocean, and pipe it. <br>
            This will give you a reliable amount of iridium, and you can continue putting Submersibles anywhere you want. <br>

        <h3> Mid game </h3>
        <p> You will probably be in mid game after getting your production up, which is when you will want to defend yourself. <br>
            Mid game is typically the time people will attack you and your base, which is why you will want to have weapons, <br>
            turrets (not turrent), point defenses, and arc turrets. <br>
            There are a number of hand-held weapons you will need, an SMG, or an assault rifle, miniguns will do fine if you're defending. <br>
            Rocket launchers, shotguns, sniper rifles, a scanner, a laser drill, and upgrades will set you up for combat, <br>
            you will want to practice combat to make sure you don't mess up while defending you and your base. <br>
            Automatic defense is a must for any base, you will need a lot of turrets, as they will fend off nearby attackers, <br>
            Point defenses as an add-on to your wall, and arc turrets, which are short range, but can deal a lot of damage to enemies. <br>
            When attacking, you can make an artillery barge, they may look something like this: <br>
            <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/484929520713990165/485600183007313930/unknown.png" class="pic"> <br>
            These may be used to deal destructive damage to the enemy, as an artillery is extremely powerful. <br>
            You can also choose to use a laser drill to cut the supports of an enemy island, their bridge holding them up, and the spatial anchor. <br>
            <img src="https://images-ext-1.discordapp.net/external/UrUgW5iL8MSMIW4LYSrNTaQG4FMa2XK_9QxaSm96NMs/https/pbs.twimg.com/media/D3HMseTWwAASd7d.png%3Alarge" width="500" class="pic"> </p>
        <h3> Late game </h3>
        <p> Late game will usually only happen for a brief while, but if teams are finally meeting their challanges, it could take a while. <br>
            Laser strikes may be easily constructed as iridium production is increased, <br>
            and a lucky team may have occupied the beacon block, which when constructed, takes 150 seconds to initialize a shower of laser strikes. <br>
            This is when the game can get extremely laggy, and when skilled players will take advantage of the slow fire rate of several defenses. <br>
            Adding as many arc turrets and turrets as possible will easily counteract the slow fire rate of defenses. </p>
